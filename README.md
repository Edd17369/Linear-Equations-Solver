## Introduction

A web app powered by Flask to calculate the solution of systems of linear equations of dimension NxN with real coefficients. The solver function is an implementaction of the Gaussâ€“Jordan elimination method and the app is deployed on Heroku [lets go to](https://www.quora.com).


## Technologies
This project was created with:
* Python 3.8.9
* Flask 1.1.2
* Sympy 1.7.1
* HTML
* CSS

## Example
For a  following system:
